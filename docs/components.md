# Components

## TensorBuffers

Access tensor data stored in TensorBuffers files from any source using memory mapping (mmap). Retrieve tensors on demand as needed.

## TensorBuffers Reader

Read TensorBuffers file from any source

## TensorBuffers Writer

Write or append tensors to a TensorBuffers file. When appending, new tensors are added after the last tensor in the file, and metadata is updated automatically.

## TensorBuffers Converters

Convert tensors from various formats to the TensorBuffers format.
